## Commenting
Since this project will be passed on to different students every year, it is important to include comments so that anyone, including someone who is brand new to the project team, can understand quickly what the code is for. It is not necessary to comment every single line, but please try to “chunk” the code and include comments for every chunk.

## Documenting and Reporting Issues
Please use GitHub Issues to note any bugs or problems that may occur. If you want to document issues in a separate Google Doc or Word document for yourself, that is fine. However, in order to help foster a collaborative and efficient workspace, it is best if we report issues on GitHub issues so that team members can have a quick overview of what is fixed, what is being fixed, and what needs to be fixed at all times.

Please follow the following template for reporting GitHub issues:

## Creating Branches
Please do not include your name in branch names. Including your name in the branch might make it seem like that everything that is being done in that branch is off limits to everyone else, which goes against the collaborative environment we are trying to create.

Please name branches something concise but descriptive of what is being accomplished in that branch. Always create a new branch if you are tackling a new problem so that only one task is being done on a single branch at all times. This will make it easier to debug code and figure out where issues stem from.

Examples of bad branch names:
	`johnny-appleseed`
	`mike-sudoku-algorithm-fix`

Examples of good branch names:
	`sudoku-fix-ui`
	`nurikabe-puzzle-check`

## Merging
For the most part, student developers should always merge into the branch `dev`. Any merges into `master` will only be from `dev`, and will be done after a confirmation from Dr. van Heuveln. As a student developer, it is important that you resolve any conflicts in `dev` before requesting to merge into `master`.
