**Note: This page is a work in progress. Please refer to the old setup guide for now until this is complete.**

For this setup guide, we will be using IntelliJ IDEA and GitHub Desktop. You can use other IDEs such as Eclipse and Visual Studio Code and stick to using the command line for Git, but we prefer using IntelliJ IDEA and GitHub Desktop.

## Installing IntelliJ IDEA
Visit the following page to download IntelliJ IDEA: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows

There are two versions of IntelliJ IDEA: IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and IntelliJ IDEA Community. You can see the differences between the Ultimate and Community versions on the installation page. For Legup development, the Community edition is all we will need, since we will never make use of the features present in the Ultimate version. However, if you are a student and you still want to get the Ultimate version (as well as other IDEs, such as PyCharm, by JetBrains) for free, visit the following page to apply for a free educational license: https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students

## Installing GitHub Desktop
Visit the following page to download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
