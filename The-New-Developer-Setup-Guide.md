**Note: This page is a work in progress. Please refer to the old setup guide for now until this is complete.**

For this setup guide, we will be using IntelliJ IDEA and GitHub Desktop. You can use other IDEs such as Eclipse and Visual Studio Code and stick to using the command line for Git, but we prefer using IntelliJ IDEA and GitHub Desktop.

## Installing IntelliJ IDEA
Visit the following page to download IntelliJ IDEA: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows

There are two versions of IntelliJ IDEA: IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and IntelliJ IDEA Community. You can see the differences between the Ultimate and Community versions on the installation page. For Legup development, the Community edition is all we will need, since we will never make use of the features present in the Ultimate version. However, if you are a student and you still want to get the Ultimate version (as well as other IDEs, such as PyCharm, by JetBrains) for free, visit the following page to apply for a free educational license: https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students

## Installing GitHub Desktop
Visit the following page to download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/

To set up GitHub Desktop, follow Parts 1 and 2 of the [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) guide. Part 3 is about contributing to projects and adding and cloning repositories, but this setup guide will walk you through this process for Legup.

## Forking the Repository
Most of the work you will doing will be in your forked repository. Follow the following steps to fork the main repository:

1. Go to the the main Legup repository: https://github.com/Bram-Hub/Legup
2. Press the "Fork" button on the top right side of the page.
3. Once you have created your own fork, navigate to it, click the green "Code" button, then press the clipboard to copy your repository's link.
