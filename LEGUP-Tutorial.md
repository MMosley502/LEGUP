LEGUP has multiple puzzles. Each puzzle has its own set of rules, but they all share common elements to make defining or interpreting a new puzzle fairly straightforward.

### Common Definitions
 - **Grid:** A coordinate plane where each coordinate consists of a single cell.
 - **Cell:** An element in a grid (usually in the form of a square).
   * A cell is unknown if its content is unknown.
   * A cell is adjacent to another cell if they are orthogonally adjacent (orthogonal directions consist of left, right, up, and down).
   * A cell adjoins another cell if they are either orthogonally or diagonally adjacent.
 - **Content:** The content or data inside a single cell.
 - **Adjacency Path:** A path of cells that are adjacent to each other.
   * i.e. A sequence of cells where any two successive cells in the sequence are adjacent to each other.
 - **Adjacency Region:** A set of cells that are all adjacent to each other.
   * i.e. For any two cells of the set there is an adjacency path from one to the other.
