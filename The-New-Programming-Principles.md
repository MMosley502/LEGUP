**This is very much in progress. Please refer to the old programming principles page until this is done.**

## Workflow
Legup uses the Feature Forking Workflow. Please refer to [this blog post](https://medium.com/@jerrylin720/git-workflow-comparison-f84d270708ab) for more information on the Feature Forking Workflow as well as other workflows.

This means that the Bram-Hub/Legup repository should have very few branches. `master` and `dev` will always exist, and beyond those two branches, there may be a few more for major features being implemented (e.g. `puzzle-editor`).
