6. Adjacency Path: A path of cells that are adjacent to each other, i.e. a sequence of cells where any two successive cells in the sequence are adjacent to each other
7. Adjacency Region: A set of cells that are all adjacent to each other, i.e. for any two cells of the set there is an adjacency path from one to the other
