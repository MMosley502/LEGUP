# Tree Tent
Tree Tent is a puzzle with unfilled squares shown in gray. Your task is to place tents in such a way that the number tents in each row and column is satisifed, and that each tree has a tent next to it

Clicking on a unfilled tile places a grass tile

Clicking on a grass tile replaces it with a tent tile

Clicking on a tent tile returns it to being unfilled

# Rules
### Here are the basic rules of the puzzle

1) Each tent is attached to one tree (so there are as many tents as there are trees).

2) The numbers across the top and down the side show how many tents are in the respective row or column.

3) A tent can only be found horizontally or vertically adjacent to a tree.

4) Tents are never adjacent to each other, neither vertically, horizontally, nor diagonally
